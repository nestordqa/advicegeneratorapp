## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS

### Continued development

I will keep developing on NextJS, Tailwind and Typescript. I think, they are greatest tools than a fullstack developer can use today.

### Useful resources
